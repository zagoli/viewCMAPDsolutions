# viewCMAPDsolutions
Utility to visualize a CMAPD solution.

It can parse solutions generated by modified versions of MCA-RMCA and an [attention-based model + PBS](https://github.com/zagoli/CMAPD).

RMCA result generated with this command: `./MAPD -m ../examples/instances/maps/0.map -a ../examples/instances/maps/0.map -t ../examples/instances/tasks/0.task -c 60 -s PP --capacity 3 --objective total-travel-delay --only-update-top --kiva --regret --screen 1`

Model result generated with this command: `python inspect_single_instance.py`

Circles are agents, squares are tasks pickup locations and annulars are tasks delivery locations. The code for the visualization is an adaptation of the code provided
with [this](http://idm-lab.org/project-p/project.html) class assignment.
