# viewCMAPDsolutions
Utility to visualize a CMAPD solution.

It can parse solutions generated by modified versions of PBS, MCA-RMCA and an [attention-based model](https://github.com/zagoli/CMAPD).

Circles are agents, squares are tasks pickup locations and annulars are tasks delivery locations. The code for the visualization is an adaptation of the code provided
with [this](http://idm-lab.org/project-p/project.html) class assignment.
